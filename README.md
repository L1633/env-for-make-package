### Usage

```bash
git clone https://github.com/L1633/env-for-make-package.git YOURFOLDERNAME
cd YOURFOLDERNAME

# Run npm install and write your library name when asked. That's all!
npm install
```

**Start coding!** `package.json` and entry files are already set up for you, so don't worry about linking to your main file, typings, etc. Just keep those files with the same name.
